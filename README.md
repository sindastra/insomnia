# [INSOMNIA!](https://github.com/sindastra/insomnia)

Insomnia is a Windows utility that **keeps your computer from going to sleep!**

This is a "fork" of https://dlaa.me/blog/post/9901642

So far this fork has:

* Updated string tables / version info
* Created proper git project with LICENSE and README.md
* Added localization: German

More things to come.
